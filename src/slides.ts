**Timeline (1960s ‚Üí 2020s)**

üü§ 1960s - Punch cards: Tedious, error-prone, physical programming.
üü† 1970s - Assembly (machine code): Directly manipulating memory and CPU instructions.
üü° 1980s - Interpreted languages (BASIC, Python): Write code, run instantly, more readable.
üü¢ 1990s - Compiled/managed (Java, C#): Code is translated and optimized for platforms, is safer.
üîµ 2020s - Prompt-based programming: Use natural language to instruct code assistants and agents.

Machine code is the lowest-level programming language, consisting of binary instructions executed directly by the CPU.

Example:
\`10111000 01100001\` (Move value 97 into register)

Writing in machine code is extremely difficult and error-prone, which is why higher-level languages were invented.
    `,
    speakerNote: "Early programming was really hard. Most developers today never see raw machine code.",

Assembly language uses mnemonics to represent machine instructions, making code slightly more readable.

Example:
\`MOV AL, 61h\` (Move value 97 into register AL)

Still requires detailed hardware knowledge and is not portable across systems.

Interpreted languages like BASIC and Python let you write code that's easy to read and run instantly.

Example (Python):
\`\`\`python
print("Hello, world!")

Compiled languages (C, C++) and managed languages (Java, C#) translate code into efficient machine instructions.

- Faster execution
- Type safety and error checking
- Large ecosystems and tooling

Example (Java):

Now, we can use natural language to instruct AI tools and agents.

- Write prompts instead of code for many tasks
- Automate repetitive work
- Focus on higher-level problem solving
Example:
\`Refactor this function to use async/await and add error handling.\`

- Be specific: Clear, detailed prompts yield better results.
- Give examples: Show the LLM what you want. Link files or add code snippets.
- Use markdown: Not just for formatting, but to structure complex prompts.
- Iterate: Refine prompts based on output.
- Use LLMs for education, review, refactoring, and documentation.
Prompting is a skill‚Äîpractice improves results!

- Store design decisions in the repo (Architecture, tech stack, design patterns)
- Keep API descriptions up to date (OpenAPI-swagger, code comments)
- Use searchable, machine-readable formats (Always prefer Markdown)
- Document everything your agent might need to see
Good documentation helps both your team and your AI tools.

**Demo Steps:**
1. Launch the Todo app in a browser tab.
   - Add a few tasks to showcase its current functionality.
2. Switch to VS Code and input the following prompt into Roo Code:
   - "read all the files in @/src/example and understand the todo app. Add a priority dropdown to tasks with options: High, Medium, Low. Save the priority in the task model and update the test to include this new feature"
3. Refresh the Todo app to see the new feature in action.
   - Verify the priority dropdown works as expected.
**Goal:** Highlight how Roo Code simplifies feature development through natural language prompts.

**Diagram:** LLM ‚Üî MCP ‚Üî Tools/APIs/Docs

**Key Points:**
- MCP = A way to declare tools, data, or sources an agent can access.
- Without it, agents can't discover APIs, doc stores, or custom workflows.
- Soon, APIs must support MCP or they'll be ignored by agents.
- Enables querying across Confluence, GitHub, OpenAPI, S3, etc.

- LLMs are not autocomplete ‚Äî they are agents in training.
- Start by replacing low-value tasks (boilerplate, rename/refactor).
- Use Roo Code to experience real-world workflows.
- Document everything your agent might need to see.
- MCP is the future of discoverability.
Prompt fluency and tooling awareness are modern dev skills. **Let's lead, not lag**.
