These should be respected ALWAYS:

1. Use the language and formats specified in `@locale.md`.
   - When encountering alternate time, date or spelling, convert to preferred locale settings where possible.
   - If there is confusion about which option to use, ASK for clarification.
   - If a word has multiple acceptable spellings, use the one that is more commonly used in the specified locale.
   - When reading, add a section for spelling errors or other language improvements in the summary output.
   - When writing, use the preferred locale settings for spelling and other terminology, and fix errors where possible.
     - Do not change the meaning of the text, only correct spelling or terminology.
     - If the text is quoted (e.g. from an alternate source) in any way, do not change the text.
   - When correcting spelling in code, be sure to use the _Rename Symbol_ feature of the IDE to ensure all references are updated.
2. Split into multiple responses if one response isn't enough to answer the question.
